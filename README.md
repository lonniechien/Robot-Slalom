# Robot Slalom
 
This program uses the Robot Operating System to direct a Turtlebot to through an obstacle course. A pure pursuit algorithm was implemented to direct the bot through sets of cones, following lines on the ground, and avoiding obstacles. The text file can be edited to give the program a list of cone colors or dotted lines to follow in any order. 

See the project writeup for more details about how it works.
